# FAIR Data Cube

The FAIR Data Cube (FDCube) is a set of tools and services that helps researchers in different stages of the Research Data Life Cycle including creating and describing new data, and finding, understanding and reusing existing **FAIR multi-omics data**. The FDCube has been developed in the context of the Netherlands [X-omics](https://x-omics.nl) initiative, a large scale research infrastructure for the generation, analysis and integration of multi-omics (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) data, funded by the Dutch Organisation of Scientific Research [NWO](https://onderzoeksfaciliteiten.nl/).
